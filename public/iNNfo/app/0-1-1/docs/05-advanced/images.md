# Image Support

You can add images to your instances in two ways:

## 1. Explicit Images (Markdown)
Simply include a standard Markdown image in the body of your instance. The first image found will be used as the instance's icon/avatar.

```markdown
## [[Character 1]]
name:: Charizard
![Portrait](https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charizard.jpg)
```

## 2. Dynamic Templates (Class Configuration)
You can define an `image_template` in your Class definition. This uses a variable substitution system (like `{{name}}` or `{{id}}`) to generate an URL automatically for instances that don't have an explicit image.

```yaml
metamodel:
  classes:
    Person:
      icon: user
      image_template: "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name={{name}}&background=random"
```

In this example, an instance with `name:: Alice` will automatically get an avatar generated by ui-avatars.com.
