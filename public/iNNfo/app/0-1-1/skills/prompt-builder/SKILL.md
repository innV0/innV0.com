# Prompt Builder Skill

The Prompt Builder is a specialized interaction flow designed to help you create high-quality prompts for different AI tools and then assist you in bringing that data back into your knowledge graph.

## Capabilities

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting specialized prompts based on specific tools, goals, and context.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Following a step-by-step process of prompt creation and subsequent data integration.
- **Data Integration**: Processing the results generated by external prompts and mapping them to the current metamodel and knowledge graph.

## Instructions

### 1. Information Gathering

When the user asks to generate a prompt, you MUST ask for the following three pieces of information if they are not already provided:

1. **Tool**: Which AI tool or platform will be used (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, a specific coding assistant, etc.).
2. **Objective**: What is the specific goal of the prompt? What should the output be?
3. **Context**: Any relevant background information, existing data from the model, or constraints that should be considered.

### 2. Prompt Generation

Once you have the necessary information, generate a clear, well-structured, and optimized prompt for the specified tool.

- Use clear headings if necessary.
- Provide instructions on how the tool should format its response (e.g., JSON, Markdown, structured text).
- Recommend best practices for that specific tool.

### 3. Post-Generation Follow-up

After providing the prompt, you MUST wait for the user to acknowledge it. Immediately after, your next question MUST be:

- "Would you like to import the information generated from this prompt into the model?"

### 4. Continuous Integration

If the user says yes:

- Ask them to paste the generated output.
- Analyze the output in relation to the existing Knowledge Graph and Metamodel.
- Propose or execute the necessary changes to import the new data (creating nodes, updating properties, or establishing relationships).

## Example

**User**: Help me create a prompt.

**Assistant**: I'd be happy to help! To build the perfect prompt for you, I need three pieces of information:

1. **Tool**: Which tool will you be using the prompt in? (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.)
2. **Objective**: What exactly do you want to achieve or generate?
3. **Context**: What background data or constraints should I include?

**User**: ChatGPT, 5 sensors for EcoBalance, focus on air quality.

**Assistant**: Here is your optimized prompt:

> "Acting as a sustainability expert, generate a list of 5 air quality sensors for the 'EcoBalance' smart city project. Provide for each: sensor name, unit of measurement, and ideal urban location. Format the output as a bulleted list."

**Assistant**: Once you have the results, would you like to import this information into our model?
