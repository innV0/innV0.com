Friendly, engaging tone.)**\n\n**Host**: \"We all have files. Folders full of notes, PDFs, and half-finished ideas. But here's the problem: your file system is 'dumb'. It doesn't know that this note is a script, or that this folder is a project. \n\nToday, I want to show you how we're changing that with **iNNfo**. We've built a system that transforms your local folders into a living Knowledge Graph. Let's look at the people using it and the real-world problems they're solving.\"\n\n---\n\n## 0:45 - 1:45 | The Content Creator: From Idea to Post\n**(Visual: Cut to icons representing the <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Content Creator\">Content Creator</entity> profile.)**\n\n**Host**: \"First up, the **Content Creator**. If you're managing a YouTube channel or a social media presence, you know the chaos of assets. \n\nIn iNNfo, creators use the <entity type=\"item\" label=\"YouTube Channel Management\">YouTube Channel Management</entity> use case to link scripts directly to their research. With <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Guionización y Storyboarding asistido por IA\">AI-assisted Storyboarding</entity>, the system doesn't just store your text; it helps you visualize the flow. It’s about moving from a 'list of files' to a 'production pipeline'—all while keeping your creative secrets private on your own disk.\"\n\n---\n\n## 1:45 - 3:00 | The Educator & Researcher: Structured Learning\n**(Visual: Split screen showing <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Educator/Trainer\">Educator</entity> and <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Researcher/Analyst\">Researcher</entity>.)**\n\n**Host**: \"Then we have the **Educators** and **Researchers**. \n\nFor teachers, the <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Creating a Course Curriculum\">Course Curriculum</entity> use case is a game-changer. You can map out lessons, link them to resources, and track progress using custom widgets. \n\nResearchers, on the other hand, use iNNfo for <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Conducting Academic Research\">Academic Research</entity>. Imagine having an AI 'Analyst' that understands the specific hierarchy of your literature review. Whether you're digging into <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Music Research (1960s Rock Bands)\">1960s Rock Bands</entity> or complex scientific data, iNNfo helps you find the 'why' behind the 'what'.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3:00 - 4:00 | The Developer: Managing Complexity\n**(Visual: Code snippets or a project board visualization.)**\n\n**Host**: \"And for my fellow technical minds, the **Developer/Engineer**. \n\nManaging a <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Managing a Software Development Project\">Software Development Project</entity> usually requires five different tools. In iNNfo, you can track requirements, features, and bugs right alongside your documentation. Because it's <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Local-First Data Persistence\">Local-First</entity> and uses Markdown, it fits perfectly into your existing Git workflow. It’s the documentation that actually stays up to date.\"\n\n---\n\n## 4:00 - 5:00 | Conclusion: Your Data, Your Rules\n**(Visual: Host back on camera, closing thoughts.)**\n\n**Host**: \"What ties all these profiles together? **Sovereignty.** \n\nWhether you're <entity type=\"item\" label=\"Building a Personal Knowledge Base\">Building a Personal Knowledge Base</entity> or running a team, iNNfo ensures your data stays yours. No cloud lock-in, just a powerful, queryable graph built on top of the folders you already have. \n\nIf you're ready to stop searching for files and start using your knowledge, it's time to give iNNfo a try. Thanks for watching.\"\n\n**(Visual: Fade to logo and 'Local-First. AI-Powered.' text.)**"},"status":"COMPLETED","rationale":"Updated markdown_file"}
