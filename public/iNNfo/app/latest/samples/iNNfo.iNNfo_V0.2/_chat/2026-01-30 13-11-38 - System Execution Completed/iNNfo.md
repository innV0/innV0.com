    **AI**: I'm connected to your model. How can I assist you today?

    ---

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    I will re-define the lost association rules in the metamodel and re-establish the relationships between items. I will also ensure the 'feature' type definition is removed as previously requested.

    Tienes razón, parece que las definiciones de las asociaciones y las relaciones se perdieron en el estado actual del metamodelo. He preparado un plan para restaurarlo todo:

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    I have identified several items and one description that are still in Spanish. This plan will use a bulk update to rename these items to their English equivalents and translate the description for 'Managing a Software Development Project' to ensure full consistency across the model.

    The previous translation task was successful, but I've noticed that several <entity type="type" label="goal">Goals</entity>, <entity type="type" label="use case">Use Cases</entity>, and <entity type="type" label="value proposition">Value Propositions</entity> are still using Spanish names. Additionally, the <prop>description</prop> for <entity type="item" label="Managing a Software Development Project">Managing a Software Development Project</entity> remains in Spanish.

    I have prepared a final translation plan to bring everything into English. Once approved, your model will be fully consistent.

    ### Next Steps

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Now that the model is translated, I am offering options to deepen the relationships between entities or generate documentation.

    The model is now fully translated into English, ensuring consistency across all <entity type="type" label="goal">Goals</entity>, <entity type="type" label="use case">Use Cases</entity>, and <entity type="type" label="value proposition">Value Propositions</entity>. 

    With the foundation now clear and accessible, we can focus on enriching the connections within your knowledge graph. Here is a summary of your current domain model:

    **User**: [SYSTEM: You have just been equipped with the "Export Wizard" skill. Introduce yourself briefly, explain your new specialized capabilities based on this skill, and suggest a few commands or tasks you can now perform efficiently. Be proactive and welcoming.]

    ---

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    I will formally activate the Export Wizard skill and configure the UI to offer immediate export options. This involves setting up the specialized persona and providing the user with quick-access buttons for common export tasks.

    Greetings! I am now your **Export Wizard**. 🧙‍♂️

    I have been specialized to act as the master coordinator for your Knowledge Model's distribution. My primary purpose is to take the complex, hierarchical structure of your model and consolidate it into beautiful, shareable, and functional documents.

    ### 🌟 My New Capabilities

    **User**: [SYSTEM: ✅ EXECUTION COMPLETED - Changes are persisted to the model.]

    ---

    **AI**: I am ready to begin. Using the **Export Wizard** module, I can now transform your distributed knowledge into a unified document.

    If we proceed with a **Full Model Export (Markdown)**, I will:
    1.  **Collect the Metamodel**: Document your 5 domain types (<entity type="type" label="goal">goal</entity>, <entity type="type" label="profile">profile</entity>, <entity type="type" label="requirement">requirement</entity>, <entity type="type" label="use case">use case</entity>, and <entity type="type" label="value proposition">value proposition</entity>).
    2.  **Gather all Instances**: Include all 23 items we've just translated, including their descriptions and field values.
    3.  **Map Relationships**: Include the connections between your <entity type="type" label="profile">Profiles</entity> and <entity type="type" label="use case">Use Cases</entity>.
    4.  **Create an Artifact**: Save the result in a new folder under `model/_artifact/` for your records.

    Which of the options below would you like to execute?

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Using the Export Wizard skill, I will consolidate the entire model (metamodel, instances, and relationships) into a single Markdown document. This document will be saved as a new artifact in the model for versioning and easy access.

    Understood! I'm initiating the **Full Model Export** to Markdown. 

    This process will consolidate all your recently translated <entity type="type" label="goal">Goals</entity>, <entity type="type" label="use case">Use Cases</entity>, and <entity type="type" label="value proposition">Value Propositions</entity>, along with the underlying metamodel structure, into a single comprehensive file.

    I will also create a new <entity type="type" label="_artifact">_artifact</entity> node named **"Model Export 2026-01-30"** to store this version.

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Offering further export formats or model refinement now that the primary documentation is secured.

    The **Full Model Export** is complete! 🧙‍♂️✨

    Using the **Export Wizard** module, I have consolidated your entire knowledge graph into a single Markdown document. 

    ### Export Results:
