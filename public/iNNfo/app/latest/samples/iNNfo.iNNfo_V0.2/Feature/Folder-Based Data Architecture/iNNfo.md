Natural Distribution: iNNfo uses your operating system's folder structure as the substrate for the model. Each folder containing an .iNNfo.md file becomes a live node (Type or Item).
Local-First & Privacy: The application is purely local and accesses your files using the File System Access API. Your data never leaves your machine, except when interacting with AI providers.
Open Format: It uses Markdown and YAML for metadata, making it compatible with tools like Obsidian, Logseq, VS Code, and version control systems like Git.
