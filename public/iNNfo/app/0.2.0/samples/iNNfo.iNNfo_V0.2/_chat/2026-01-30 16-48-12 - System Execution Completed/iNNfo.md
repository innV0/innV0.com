    **AI**: I'm connected to your model. How can I assist you today?

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Activating the Gardener skill to perform a comprehensive health check. I will focus on formalizing the 'hidden' relationships identified in the Architecture Map, standardizing language consistency, and cleaning up system logs.

    Using the **Model Curator (Gardener)** module, I have initiated a gardening session to improve the health and connectivity of your knowledge graph.
  🌿 Gardening Report: |-
    1.  **Structural Integrity**: I noticed that while you have a beautiful <entity type="item" label="System Architecture Map 2026">Architecture Map</entity>, the actual graph relationships (<entity type="type" label="Association">Associations</entity>) are not yet defined in the metamodel. I have proposed defining rules like `Requirement` → `satisfied_by` → `feature`.
    2.  **Language Consistency**: Some items like <entity type="item" label="preparación de materiales lectivos">preparación de materiales lectivos</entity> were in Spanish while the rest of the model is in English. I've proposed renaming them for better indexing and searchability.
    3.  **Missing Metadata**: I've identified several <entity type="type" label="Profile">Profiles</entity> and <entity type="type" label="Use Case">Use Cases</entity> with empty descriptions and provided initial definitions to enrich the context.
    4.  **Log Management**: The system log is growing; once these changes are approved, I recommend archiving the current log to the <entity type="item" label="_log_archive">History Archive</entity>.

    How would you like to proceed with these improvements?

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Using the Gardener skill, I have identified several 'implicit' connections where items reference each other in text fields (like 'actor') but lack formal graph relationships. I will now bridge these islands to create a fully traversable knowledge graph.

    Using the **Model Curator (Gardener)** module, I've completed a **Relationship Gap Analysis**. 

    I found that while your <entity type="type" label="Profile">Profiles</entity> and <entity type="type" label="Use Case">Use Cases</entity> were conceptually linked, they were "islands" in the graph. I've prepared a plan to formalize **8 new relationships** based on the content of the nodes.

    **AI**: **Strategy:**
    Now that the model's connectivity has been significantly improved, I will perform a final audit to ensure no orphans remain and generate a fresh 'Health Report' artifact to document the current state of the Knowledge Graph.

    Using the **Model Curator (Gardener)** module, I have verified the successful integration of the new relationships. Your knowledge graph is now significantly more robust and traversable.
