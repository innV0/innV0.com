# Getting Started with uNNimod

Welcome! uNNimod works differently from typical cloud apps. We follow a **Local-First** philosophy, meaning all your data stays on your computer.

## How to Start a New Project

1.  **Create a Folder**: 
    - Go to your computer's Desktop or Documents.
    - Create a new empty folder. Name it whatever you like (e.g., `MyFirstModel`).

2.  **Open the Folder in uNNimod**:
    - Go back to the uNNimod "Welcome" screen.
    - Click **"Load Existing Model"** (or the folder icon).
    - Select the folder you just created.
    - Grant permission if the browser asks.

3.  **Initialize Your Model**:
    - Once the empty folder is loaded, uNNimod will see it contains no models.
    - You will then see an option to **"Start from Scratch"**.
    - Click this to generate your first `.nn.md` file and begin modeling!

## Why Local Folders?

- **Ownership**: You own your files (markdown).
- **Privacy**: No data is sent to our servers.
- **Portability**: You can zip the folder and share it, or track it with Git.
