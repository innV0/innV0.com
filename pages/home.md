We focus on identifying and implementing innovation opportunities that deliver high value with minimal risk, ensuring that innovation is accessible and practical. It won't help you win the most disruptive innovation award of the year, but it will help you start working and developing the innovation capacity in your company, by implementing pragmatic simple innovation management processes.

## Start innovating yesterday

The best moment to start innovating is yesterday. Using innV0, you'll be able to save time and go faster on your journey towards innovation. We've taken care of creating the tools and methodologies that will enable you to go much faster in the first steps of implementing an innovation management system. It will be as if you had started six months ago. 

### Our Approach:
- **Focus on High-Impact, Low-Risk Opportunities:** We prioritize projects that provide significant value without requiring massive investments or complex changes.
- **Leveraging Proven Methodologies:** We use methodologies like Lean Startup and Design Thinking, adapted for intrapreneurship, to help organizations innovate from within.
- **Simple Tools for Big Results:** Our tools include a maturity assessment to help you understand your current innovation level and a portfolio management tool to organize and develop your innovation ideas into actionable projects.
- **Building a Culture of Innovation:** We aim to foster a mindset that values continuous improvement and sees innovation as an ongoing journey rather than an overwhelming challenge.
- **Harnessing the Power of AI:** We explore the unprecedented opportunities that artificial intelligence offers, from streamlining administrative processes to sparking creative new product ideas.

## Solution Structure
**Modular Work Units**: Self-contained building blocks you can plug into existing workflows or run as standalone sprints
**Inputs**: Key documents, concepts, and tools such as strategic plans, customer personas, and ideation templates
**Tasks**:
- Autonomous exercises: Pre-recorded videos and guided worksheets for self-paced work
- Guided workshops: Live or virtual sessions led by our innovation coaches to deepen learning and collaboration
**Outputs**: Tangible deliverables like opportunity maps, idea scorecards, prototype schematics, and user-test summaries
## Our Process Flow
We provide minimalist educational content to ensure clients grasp concepts before activities to maximize workshop efficiency with a shared vocabulary. This includes pre-session short clips (3–5 minutes) explaining core concepts, best practices, and case studies, as well as one-page briefs summarizing definitions, frameworks, and activity instructions.
##### Self-Diagnostic (AI-Guided)
Method: Online chatbot questionnaire that assesses current innovation capabilities and mindset
Focus: Measures risk tolerance, leadership buy-in, resource allocation, failure mindset, etc., and generates a personalized report highlighting strengths and gaps
##### Initial Diagnosis
Method: Facilitated discovery session where stakeholders map out existing processes, pain points, and potential quick wins
Deliverable: Current State & Opportunity Map – a visual chart showing high-impact areas to address first
##### Idea Generation & Evaluation
Activities: Guided brainstorming (e.g., SCAMPER, How-Might-We) followed by weighted scoring of ideas
Deliverable: Ranked Idea Backlog with rationale and estimated benefits for each concept
##### Prototype Conceptualization
Method: Rapid design sprint to sketch, decide, and storyboard key features
Deliverables: Low-fidelity mock-ups and user journey sketches to illustrate core experiences
##### Validation & Feedback
Activities: User interviews and usability tests to capture quantitative and qualitative data
Deliverable: Feedback & Insights Report with actionable recommendations on improvements, pivots, or eliminations
##### Iteration & Refinement
Purpose: Continuous improvement through lean cycles to refine prototypes, optimize features, and prepare for pilot launch
Deliverable: Refined Prototype & Next Steps Plan outlining final mock-ups and a roadmap for scaling

## Integration with Best-Practice Methodologies
- 24 Steps of Disciplined Entrepreneurship: End-to-end framework for building a scalable venture from idea to launch
- Lean Startup: Build–Measure–Learn cycles emphasizing quick experiments and data-driven decisions
- Running Lean: Rapid hypothesis validation to align teams on assumptions, risks, and metrics
- Design Thinking: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test for human-centered solutions

## Key Benefits
- Clarity: Defined path eradicates confusion and aligns teams
- Speed: Jump from zero to prototype in weeks, not months
- Risk Mitigation: Test assumptions early to reduce costly missteps
- Empowerment: Builds client capability through guided autonomy and learning

## Clients
Allocated innovation budget: Companies that have dedicated funding for R&D or innovation initiatives
Desire for structured innovation: Organizations looking for a clear process to manage their innovation efforts effectively.
Awareness of the need to innovate: Teams that recognize stagnation risks and are motivated to adopt new approaches
No established innovation process: Organizations lacking internal frameworks, templates, or experience to systematically innovate

## Case Example

#### Mid-Sized Event Company (40 Employees)
Profile: Overwhelmed with manual processes yet eager to innovate without derailing operations
Application Steps:
AI Self-Diagnostic Chatbot identifies lack of formal process and moderate risk aversion
Initial Diagnosis Workshop uncovers scheduling chaos and manual speaker coordination
Idea Workshop Generates concepts like speaker-management dashboard and email automation
Prototype Sprint Designs wireframes for dashboard and automated flow in one day
Validation Conducts usability tests with staff and a pilot cohort of attendees, gathering NPS and task-completion data
Iterations Refines UI elements and workflow logic; simplifies onboarding steps
Outcome: Pilot tool saves 30 % of planning time and increases on-time communications by 80 %
Insights: Leadership will fund full rollout after seeing pilot ROI and show openness to external tech partnerships, preferring small-scale pilots before enterprise-wide changes
