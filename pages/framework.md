# Innovation Management Framework

This document outlines a practical, integrated innovation management framework designed to guide organizations that are just starting to implement innovation management or are in very early stages. It aims to be pragmatic, helping organizations take their first steps into the world of innovation in a simple way, prioritizing the most obvious innovation opportunities that can yield the greatest results with fewer resources and in the simplest, most straightforward manner. The model is structured into two fundamental and interconnected dimensions: **Design** and **Execution**. Each dimension covers specific disciplines, supported by tools, that guide the organization from a strategic self-assessment to the systematic implementation and monitoring of innovation initiatives, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and growth.

## Framework Dimensions

### Design Dimension

This dimension focuses on establishing the strategic foundations for innovation. Its objective is to align innovation efforts with the company's vision and overall goals, deeply understanding the organization, and planning its long-term development. The emphasis here is on simplicity and identifying immediate, high-impact areas.

#### 1\. Maturity Assessment and Prioritization

* **Description:** This involves a focused diagnosis to determine the organization's current state of maturity in innovation management. This process evaluates existing capabilities, basic processes, culture, and initial strategic alignment to identify key strengths and weaknesses. The outcome helps the organization understand its starting point (e.g., initial or emerging state) and prioritize the most impactful and straightforward areas for improvement that can yield quick wins.  
* **Tool:** evaluatioNN.

#### 2\. Organization Description

* **Description:** This goes beyond the company's core activity. It entails a concise analysis of the current business model, basic organizational culture, key competitive landscape, core internal capabilities (talent and resources), and the immediate market context. This definition is crucial for ensuring that the initial innovation strategy is grounded in the organization's reality and aligned with its fundamental strategic goals, focusing on what is most accessible.  
* **Tool:** organizatioNN.

#### 3\. Innovation Management Planning

* **Description:** This is the creation of a simple, actionable strategic roadmap to elevate the organization's innovation maturity level. This plan defines clear, achievable objectives, basic key performance indicators (KPIs), allocates initial budgets, establishes clear roles and responsibilities, and sets a realistic timeline. It is the master plan that will guide the initial transformation of the company's innovative capacity, prioritizing low-hanging fruit.  
* **Tool:** plaNN.

### Execution Dimension

Once the initial strategy is defined, this dimension focuses on the implementation, management, and optimization of daily innovation activities. It translates the strategy into concrete actions and measurable results, always with a focus on simplicity and efficiency for organizations just starting out.

#### 1\. Program Design

* **Description:** This involves the tactical structuring of initial programs that will drive innovation. This includes defining specific, straightforward objectives for each program (e.g., simple product improvements, basic process enhancements), easily measurable success metrics (KPIs), basic resource allocation, and establishing clear governance. Each program functions as a direct engine to execute a part of the overall innovation strategy, focusing on what's manageable.  
* **Tool:** desigNN.

#### 2\. Opportunity Management

* **Description:** This is the systematic process for feeding the innovation engine, focusing on identifying obvious and easily accessible opportunities. It covers basic idea generation (e.g., from customer feedback, simple market observation), identification of clear market opportunities, and a pragmatic evaluation of each. A simplified innovation funnel is established to filter and select ideas with the highest potential based on strategic fit, feasibility with existing resources, and clear desirability, always prioritizing the simplest path to impact.  
* **Tool:** opportuNNities.

#### 3\. Initiative Management

* **Description:** This focuses on the agile tracking and development of selected opportunities, turning them into concrete projects with minimal complexity. Using pragmatic methodologies (e.g., a simplified Lean Startup approach), the iterative development of initiatives is managed, from a basic prototype to a minimum viable product (MVP) and its initial scaling. A fundamental pillar is the continuous validation of simple hypotheses to ensure the technical, commercial, and financial viability of the project, minimizing risks and maximizing learning with limited resources.  
* **Tool:** iNNitiatives.
