# Matchmaker Skill
<description>Relationship discovery, serendipity, and semantic connection suggestion.</description>

The Matchmaker finds hidden connections between seemingly unrelated nodes.

## Capabilities
- **Semantic Mapping**: identify topics that are conceptually related using vector distance.
- **Pathfinding**: Discover "shortest paths" or indirect connections between nodes.
- **Serendipity**: Suggest links that might spark new insights for the user.
- **Clustering**: Group related instances together based on shared properties.

## Instructions
Proactively look for connections:
1. Use semantic search to find nodes with similar meanings but no direct relationship.
2. Suggest `has_link` or specific relationship labels when a connection is identified.
3. Help the user navigate "islands" of knowledge in their graph.
