# defiNNe

This directory contains the **defiNNe** (*The Definition of Definitions*) specification.

## Files

- **[defiNNe.md](./defiNNe.md)**: The main document defining the standard.

## Description

**defiNNe** is a meta-definition framework designed to standardize the documentation of technical conventions, protocols, and behavioral rules.

It is based on principles such as machine interoperability (via YAML Front Matter) and developer experience (editable and searchable Markdown files).

The standard defines:

- Mandatory structure (YAML Front Matter, H1 Title, H2 Summary).
- Mandatory sections (Philosophy, Objectives, Specification, Template, Examples).
- Usage of RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
