    ## 0:00 - 0:45 | Introduction: The Knowledge Problem
    **(Visual: Host in a clean office/studio setting. Friendly, engaging tone.)**

    **Host**: "We all have files. Folders full of notes, PDFs, and half-finished ideas. But here's the problem: your file system is 'dumb'. It doesn't know that this note is a script, or that this folder is a project. 

    Today, I want to show you how we're changing that with **iNNfo**. We've built a system that transforms your local folders into a living Knowledge Graph. Let's look at the people using it and the real-world problems they're solving."

    ## 0:45 - 1:45 | The Content Creator: From Idea to Post
    **(Visual: Cut to icons representing the <entity type="item" label="Content Creator">Content Creator</entity> profile.)**

    **Host**: "First up, the **Content Creator**. If you're managing a YouTube channel or a social media presence, you know the chaos of assets. 

    In iNNfo, creators use the <entity type="item" label="YouTube Channel Management">YouTube Channel Management</entity> use case to link scripts directly to their research. With <entity type="item" label="Guionización y Storyboarding asistido por IA">AI-assisted Storyboarding</entity>, the system doesn't just store your text; it helps you visualize the flow. It’s about moving from a 'list of files' to a 'production pipeline'—all while keeping your creative secrets private on your own disk."

    ## 1:45 - 3:00 | The Educator & Researcher: Structured Learning
    **(Visual: Split screen showing <entity type="item" label="Educator/Trainer">Educator</entity> and <entity type="item" label="Researcher/Analyst">Researcher</entity>.)**

    **Host**: "Then we have the **Educators** and **Researchers**. 

    For teachers, the <entity type="item" label="Creating a Course Curriculum">Course Curriculum</entity> use case is a game-changer. You can map out lessons, link them to resources, and track progress using custom widgets. 

    Researchers, on the other hand, use iNNfo for <entity type="item" label="Conducting Academic Research">Academic Research</entity>. Imagine having an AI 'Analyst' that understands the specific hierarchy of your literature review. Whether you're digging into <entity type="item" label="Music Research (1960s Rock Bands)">1960s Rock Bands</entity> or complex scientific data, iNNfo helps you find the 'why' behind the 'what'."

    ## 3:00 - 4:00 | The Developer: Managing Complexity
    **(Visual: Code snippets or a project board visualization.)**

    **Host**: "And for my fellow technical minds, the **Developer/Engineer**. 

    Managing a <entity type="item" label="Managing a Software Development Project">Software Development Project</entity> usually requires five different tools. In iNNfo, you can track requirements, features, and bugs right alongside your documentation. Because it's <entity type="item" label="Local-First Data Persistence">Local-First</entity> and uses Markdown, it fits perfectly into your existing Git workflow. It’s the documentation that actually stays up to date."

    ## 4:00 - 5:00 | Conclusion: Your Data, Your Rules
    **(Visual: Host back on camera, closing thoughts.)**

    **Host**: "What ties all these profiles together? **Sovereignty.** 

    Whether you're <entity type="item" label="Building a Personal Knowledge Base">Building a Personal Knowledge Base</entity> or running a team, iNNfo ensures your data stays yours. No cloud lock-in, just a powerful, queryable graph built on top of the folders you already have. 

    If you're ready to stop searching for files and start using your knowledge, it's time to give iNNfo a try. Thanks for watching."
