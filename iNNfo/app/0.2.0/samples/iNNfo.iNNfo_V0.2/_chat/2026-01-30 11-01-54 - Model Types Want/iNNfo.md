    **AI**: The current model effectively outlines the flow from a <entity type="type" label="Profile">Profile</entity> executing a <entity type="type" label="Use Case">Use Case</entity> that utilizes a <entity type="type" label="Feature">Feature</entity> to obtain a <entity type="type" label="Value Proposition">Value Proposition</entity>. To enhance this model for more comprehensive product development or strategic analysis, I suggest adding types and relationships that provide deeper context and traceability.

    Here are some suggestions for expanding your model:

    1.  **<entity type="type" label="Goal">Goal</entity> Type**: This type would represent the higher-level objectives that your <entity type="type" label="Value Proposition">Value Proposition</entity>s aim to achieve. It helps in understanding the strategic alignment of your offerings.
