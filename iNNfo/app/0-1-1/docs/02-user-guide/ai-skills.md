# AI Skills

kNNowledge's AI Assistant is equipped with specialized **Skills**. These skills allow the AI to perform specific tasks more effectively by switching into specialized "modes" of operation.

## How Skills Work

Skills are activated in two ways:
1.  **Auto-Activation**: The AI detects the context of your request and automatically activates the most relevant skills.
2.  **Manual Selection**: You can manually toggle skills in the AI Assistant header to force the AI to use specific capabilities.

When a skill is active, you'll see it blinking in the AI Assistant's skill selector.

## Dynamic Collaboration

The AI Assistant can use multiple skills simultaneously. For example, when building a new feature:
-   The **Strategic Planner** creates the roadmap.
-   The **Architect** defines the new classes.
-   The **Coder** generates the implementation logic.
-   The **Visualizer** creates diagrams to explain the structure.

This multi-skill approach ensures that the AI's output is not just a simple response, but a high-quality, professional result aligned with your specific needs.
