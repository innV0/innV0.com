**iNNfo** is a local-first knowledge management framework designed to organize your folders, documents, data, files, and images in a structured way that works seamlessly with AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Define Your Domain**: Use the sidebar to create new Classes or ask the AI Assistant to design a metamodel for you.
2. **Create Instances**: Once you have classes, create folders in your model to represent specific items.
3. **Connect Everything**: Use relationships to build a rich graph of knowledge.
4. **AI Assistance**: Talk to the assistant to process sources, create plans, or analyze your graph.

## System Nodes

- **Skills**: Define what the AI can do.
- **Plans**: Organize complex work.
- **Sources**: Import external knowledge.
- **Artifacts**: Store generated content.

Happy Modeling!
