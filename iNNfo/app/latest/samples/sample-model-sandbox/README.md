# Welcome to the Sample Model Sandbox! 🚀

You've just connected a **Distributed iNNfo Model**. This is the future of knowledge management architecture.

## 🎯 Your First Steps (Onboarding)

1. **Explore the Hierarchy**: Look at the sidebar (Model tab). You'll see two types: **Scientist** and **Theory**.
2. **View an Item**: Click on **Scientist** and then on **Einstein**. You'll see his profile, biography, and linked theories.
3. **Check the Matrix**: Switch to the **Relations** tab to see how Einstein is connected to "General Relativity" through the `developed` relationship.
4. **Add Your Own**:
   - Go to the **Theory** type.
   - Click the **"+" (Plus)** button to create a new theory (e.g., "Quantum Mechanics").
   - Try linking it to a scientist!

## 📂 Under the Hood

Everything you see here is stored in your local folder:

- **Folders** = Nodes (Types or Items).
- **iNNfo.md** = Metadata & schema.
- **Attachments** = Any files you drop inside those folders.

Enjoy building your digital brain!
